# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the **resale price of cars** based on features like year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more.  
It applies machine learning regression models with proper **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning**.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `data/` → Sample dataset (full dataset link in README)  
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebook with EDA, model training, and evaluation  
- `README.md` → Documentation  

---

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
2. Data preprocessing (missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling)  
3. Feature engineering (derived features such as car age, fuel efficiency)  
4. Model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.)  
5. Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV)  
6. Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R² Score)
