# Predictive Models for Patient's Treatment Decisions in Breast Cancer

This project develops machine learning models to predict:
- **Pathological Complete Response (PCR)** using classification.
- **Relapse-Free Survival (RFS)** using regression.

The study uses MRI-based radiomic features and clinical trial data (ACRIN 6698/I-SPY2 dataset).
