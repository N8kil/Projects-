## 🚀 Workflow
1. Data preprocessing (cleaning, stopword removal, lemmatization)  
2. Feature extraction (TF-IDF vectorization)  
3. Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes)  
4. Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)  
5. Visualization (WordClouds for spam vs ham messages)
