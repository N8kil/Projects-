🎬 Movie Rating Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict movie ratings (similar to IMDB scores) using machine learning models. The dataset includes information such as genre, budget, director, cast, and user reviews. The goal was to build a robust pipeline that can handle diverse data types and generate accurate rating predictions.

📊 Dataset

Features:

Categorical: Genre, Director, Actors

Numerical: Budget, Revenue, Duration

Text: User reviews, summaries

Target Variable:

Movie Rating (continuous value, e.g., 1–10 scale)

⚙️ Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values (imputation strategies).

Performed one-hot encoding for categorical features (genre, director).

Applied TF-IDF for textual reviews.

Normalized/standardized numerical features (budget, revenue, duration).

Train-test split with stratification to maintain distribution.

🤖 Models Tried

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM)

Multi-Layer Perceptron (Neural Network)

🏆 Best Model

Gradient Boosting delivered the lowest RMSE on validation data.

Feature importance analysis revealed:

Budget and Genre had the highest influence on ratings.

Director and Actor popularity were also strong predictors.

📈 Results

Gradient Boosting achieved the best performance with strong generalization.

Evaluation Metrics:

RMSE: XX (replace with actual)

MAE: YY (replace with actual)

R² Score: ZZ (replace with actual)

🚀 Key Learnings

Importance of feature engineering when working with mixed data types (numeric, categorical, text).

Gradient Boosting models outperform simpler linear models for complex relationships.

Textual features (reviews) significantly improve predictive accuracy.
